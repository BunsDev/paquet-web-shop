## ❓ FAQ
* Why are there so few apps?
	* Paquet is still growing, I am doing my best to add as many apps as possible.
* How do I submit an app?
	* Just drop an issue with the link to the web app you would like to see.
* What if my app is here and I don't like it?
	* Well that's a bummer. But if you don't like that your app is on Paquet, just let me know and I'll remove it as soon as possible.
